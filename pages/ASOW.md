## Long Waves Propagating over Circular Island

An analytic solution of long waves scattering by a cylindrical island mounted on a permeable circular shoal was obtained by solving the linear long wave equation LWE. 
The solution is in terms of the Bessel function expressed by complex variables. The present solution is suitable for arbitrary bottom configurations described by a power function with two independent parameters.(Kuo et al., 2012)

## Wave over Axi-symmetric Topography (San, 2014)

The newly derived solution is further employed to investigate the key patterns of wave transformation over a circular island mounted on different axi-symmetric shoals and different submerged truncated axi-symmetric shoals subjecting to varying conditions of incident wave period and values of the arbitrary power of radial distance.
