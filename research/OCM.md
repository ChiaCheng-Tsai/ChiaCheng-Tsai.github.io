# 3D Numerical Simulation of Kuroshio-Induced Wake near Green Island, Taiwan

In this study, vortex shedding downstream of Green Island, due to passing of the Kuroshio was numerically studied using the three-dimensional Princeton Ocean Model. 
Temporal and spatial characteristics of the vortex street were analyzed at different tidal levels, wind directions and water depths. 
The vortex shedding obtained by the model was compared with the shipboard ADCP measurements and the MODIS satellite image.
