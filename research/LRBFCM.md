## Local Radial Basis Function Collocation Method

The local radial basis function collocation method (LRBFCM) based on the multiquadric type radial basis function is used to simulate the water wave propagation with oblique incidence and radiation.
The LRBFCM is a meshless numerical method and its applications to the high-order radiation boundary condition are much simpler compared with the traditional numericalmethods. (Tsai et al., 2015)
