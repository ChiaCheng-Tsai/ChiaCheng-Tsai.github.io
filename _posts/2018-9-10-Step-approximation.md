title: Step approximation of water wave scattering caused by tension-leg structures over uneven bottoms
---


[Our paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801818308035) is published in [Ocean Engineering](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/ocean-engineering).  We study the scattering of water waves induced by tension leg structures (TLSs) over uneven bottoms using the eigenfunction matching method (EMM).
