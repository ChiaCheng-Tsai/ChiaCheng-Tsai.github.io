Congraulation for Cathy for her first SCI paper published in [Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955799720301843). In this study, a symmetric method of approximate particular solutions (MAPS) is proposed for solving certain partial differential equations (PDEs). Similar to the unsymmetric MAPS, the right-hand-side of the governing equation is mainly approximated by the MQ in the proposed method. Numerical results with different shape parameters are analyzed to show that the symmetric methods are more stable.
