In this [study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19942060.2018.1432507), a quadtree-adaptive viscous numerical wave tank in which the free surface is resolved by the volume of fluid method is established to solve Bragg resonance caused by Stokes and cnoidal waves. Numerical wavemakers of third-order cnoidal and fifth-order Stokes waves are implemented. Additionally, a numerical damping zone is implemented such that the numerical grid in that area is automatically coarsened under a prescribed low resolution in which the time-matching is more efficient without an excessively small time-step.
