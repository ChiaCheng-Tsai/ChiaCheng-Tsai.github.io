I migrated to [National Taiwan Ocean University](https://www.ntou.edu.tw/4) on Aug 1, 2021. I am now a full professor in [Bachelor Degree Program in Ocean Engineering and Technology](https://www.ntou.edu.tw/academics/oet) and the Director of [Center of Excellence for Ocean Engineering](https://www.ntou.edu.tw/academics/ceoe) in NTOU. I regularly go to the Mazu campus every two weeks.
