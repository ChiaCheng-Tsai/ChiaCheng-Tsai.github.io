Congraulation for You for his paper published in Journal of Marine Science and Engineering. In this study, the Bragg reflections of oblique water waves by periodic surface-piercing structures over periodic bottoms are investigated using the eigenfunction matching method (EMM). The proposed EMM is validated by several examples in the literature. Then, the method is applied to solve Bragg reflections of oblique water waves by various surface-piercing structures over periodic bottoms. From the numerical experiments, Braggâ€™s law of oblique waves was used to predict the occurrences of Bragg resonance.
