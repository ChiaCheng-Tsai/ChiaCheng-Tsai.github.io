Congratulation to Dr. Yueh-Ting Lin. He has published a great paper entitled: "A coupled-mode study on weakly viscous Bragg scattering of surface gravity waves". Some highlights are given as: 

* A coupled-mode model of weakly viscous wave motion is developed and validated.
- Bragg scattering of weakly viscous wave propagating over ripples and artificial submerged breakwaters is investigated.
- Computational efficiency can be significantly improved by sparse matrix solver.
