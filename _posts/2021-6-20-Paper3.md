Our new SCI paper entitled: "Meshfree model for earthquake-induced transient response in a porous seabed" is published in 
[Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267726121001354). In this study, we develope a meshfree method to predict the soil response
under the Japan 311 earthquake, based on the “u 􀀀 p” approximation
