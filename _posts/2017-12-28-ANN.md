title: ANN for Forecasting Wave Heights along a Ship’s Route during Hurricanes
---

Congratulate to Prof. Wei. Our paper of Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal, and Ocean Engineering is online. A data-driven prediction model using numerical solutions is proposed for forecasting wave heights along shipping routes during hurricanes. The developed model can be used to determine the wave heights on a ship’s trajectory, considering a short time step of a ship’s operation.
