Congraulation for Hou for his paper published in Proc IMechE Part M: J Engineering for the Maritime Environment. In this study, we develope an adaptive model to simulate the typhoon-induced waves. Higher-resolution data are obtained from the government of Taiwan and are used for the area around Taiwan. In the other area, lower resolution data are adopted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States. An adaption criterion is implemented such that the highest-resolution numerical grids move with the typhoon in a large-scale simulation. The numerical results obtained by the large-scale simulation with multiple-resolution wind fields are improved over those obtained by a smaller scale simulation with the higher-resolution wind field at buoys near Taiwan.
