title: Back to GitHub Pages
---

I am back to build personal site using GitHub Pages. Check my old website [here](https://chenllab.com). I decided to move back for three reasons:

0. Web hosting is not cheap and I do not want to take care of that.  
0. For simply web pages, GitHub Pages is easier to customize for me as compared to others. 
0. It is convenient to map GitHub Pages to my own domain. I am planning to keep my old domain name and map this site to it soon.
